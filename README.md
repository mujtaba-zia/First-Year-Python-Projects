# First Year Engineering Projects

This repository contains three projects developed during my first year of engineering. Each project demonstrates different aspects of programming, data analysis, and problem solving.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Rover Travel Time Calculator
- **Description:**  
  A terminal-based application that computes the travel time for a rover by considering mission distance, rover specifications (battery, energy efficiency, solar capacity, and average speed), and weather conditions (such as storms).
- **Key Features:**  
  - User inputs include the rover selection, mission distance, and whether a storm is forecasted.
  - Calculates travel time by taking into account base speed and additional charging time when needed.
  - Adjusts the computed travel time if storm conditions are present.
- **How to Run:**  
  Run the following command in your terminal:


### 2. Movie Awards Analyzer
- **Description:**  
A command-line tool for analyzing movie awards data. It allows users to search for a specific movie to see how many awards it has won or to display the winners from a selected awards list.
- **Key Features:**  
- Imports data from a separate file (`awards_data.py`) that contains multiple awards lists.
- Includes functions to standardize text, count awards for movies, and display the winners.
- Interactive prompts guide the user through searching and displaying awards information.
- **How to Run:**  
Execute the following command in your terminal:



### 3. Spotify Data Analysis
- **Description:**  
An interactive terminal application that processes and visualizes Spotify data using NumPy for data handling and Matplotlib for plotting.
- **Key Features:**  
- Analyzes various song attributes such as danceability, energy, valence, and more.
- Provides statistical insights (like highest, lowest, and mean values) for selected song features.
- Generates visualizations including bar charts and scatter plots for enhanced data analysis.
- **Dependencies:**  
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- **How to Run:**  
Ensure you have the required dependencies installed, then run:

*Note: The project requires the CSV data file (`spotify_data.csv`) to be in the same directory.*

## General Notes
- **Environment:**  
All projects are developed using Python 3 and are intended to be run via the command line.
- **Data Files:**  
- For the Movie Awards Analyzer, ensure that `awards_data.py` remains in the same directory as `awards.py`.
- The Spotify project depends on `spotify_data.csv`; please keep it in the repository folder.
- **User Interaction:**  
Each project is interactive and will prompt you for input as needed.
